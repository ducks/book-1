# The intermezzOS book

The book is **very much** a work in progress. Even with that,
there are two versions!

- [First Edition](./first-edition/index.html)
- [Second Edition](second-edition/)

We started with the first edition, but before we even finished it, some new
awesome stuff popped up, and so we're starting over.

That said, we're just starting, so the second edition is basically blank at the
moment. Check out the first edition for now, and hopefully the second will be
awesome soon.

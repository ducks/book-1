# What kind are we making?

So, given all these kinds of operating systems, what kind are we making?

The answer is “it doesn’t even matter at first.” There’s some commonality in
almost all of these styles of operating systems, and we have to get all that
done before we even make those decisions.

Secondly, we could waste a _lot_ of time trying to design our perfect OS. And
then never actually build it. Remember, the goal here is _to learn_, not _to
make the best OS that ever existed_. So really, what it ends up looking like
just doesn’t really matter at all. Most hobby operating system projects die
quite young.

Let’s focus on the _doing_, and less on the categorization, planning, and
being. A nice thing about operating systems is that there’s a lot of freedom of
direction. To tie it back into the example earlier, Phil’s tutorial starts
going into memory-management after getting printing to the screen going. We’ll
be going into keyboards first instead. There are, of course, some dependencies,
but there’s also a lot of freedom.
